## 🤖 Agent Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

This project requires strict adherence to my global professional standards.

**Global Standards Location:**
All mandatory skills and instructions are located in: `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`

**Mandatory Action for Agent:**

1. **Full Indexing Required:** You MUST scan and index all available skills in the directory above at the beginning of the conversation.
2. **Strict Adherence:** You are required to follow every instruction, best practice, and security standard defined in those skills. Do not ignore or overlook any of them.
3. **Always Active:** These skills must be treated as your primary operational rules. Always cross-check your output against these global standards for architecture, coding, security, and design.
4. **No Omissions:** If a task falls under the scope of any installed skill, you MUST apply its rules automatically without being asked.
